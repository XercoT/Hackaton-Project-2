// Submission for UMD Annual Hackaton

## Inspiration
- We took profound inspiration from resources such as Handshake & LinkedIn to design a platform equal in providing internships, events as well as AI assistance in guidance to our users IT journey.  We saw an issue on how Job Searching and gaining experience can be extremely oversaturated and tedious, especially when both internships and careers are both conjoined in the same category. We wanted to eliminate this overlap and provide a platform directed solely towards current college students and their success.
## What it does
- Our app provides beginner-friendly internships for current college students, granting them access to invaluable work experience and opportunities. Additionally, we provide events to compliment users who would like to step outside their comfort zone and discover like-minded individuals within the field of IT.  Lastly, we integrated an AI chatbot, intended for users to explore internships outside of our vast collections of connections.
## How we built it
- We built our app using SwiftUI & Firebase. Utilizing Swift, we designed the framework for our app; creating the UI's as well as the ChatBot within Xcode. Furthermore, we leveraged our external data using FireBase(a cloud provider service) to organize our events and internships.
## Challenges we ran into
- Our greatest challenge within this Hackathon was attempting to integrate MongoDB as our main database storage for our internships and events. It was truly a tedious and steep learning curve that even still, after this 24-hour Hackathon, we still need more experience using it. If given more time, we would love to discover the ways and methods on how to manipulate, store, and extract data from MongoDB.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Our biggest accomplishment was constructing our first AI chatbot. It was a new experience that brought its own unforeseen challenges and dilemmas. Nonetheless, the pleasure after completing and watching our code work was euphoric, and being given to compete again, we could love to fine-tune and design a stronger AI model.
## What we learned
- Coding is a long process of trial and error. In its own way, it's a science experiment where we're the science test and our code is the experiment. Having a open, flexible and dynamic mindset will truly help in the discovery of new methods of solving a problem.
## What's next for TechConnect
- For hope to continue to add events and utilize API to automatically update and filter out internships intended for our main target audience. Additionally, we could love to fine-tune our AI chatbot as well as add a community page for users to publish their own internships and opportunities that they may find.
